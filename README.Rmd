# GSDCovAdj

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of GSDCovAdj is to combine group sequential, information-adaptive designs with covariate adjustment 

Kelly Van Lancker, Josh Betz and Michael Rosenblum

## Installation

Before installation of the development version of **GSDCovAdj**, we recommend installing the package simul from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nt-williams/simul")
```

You can install the development version of GSDCovAdj from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("kelvlanc/GSDCovAdj")
```

## Scope

**GSDCovAdj** implements the methods proposed by Van Lancker, Betz and Rosenblum (2022) to combine group sequential, information-adaptive designs with covariate adjustment. 
The approach is implemented for a G-computation and targeted maximum likelihood estimator for continuous and binary outcomes, and for the estimator proposed by DÃ­az et al. (2019) for time-to-event outcomes.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(GSDCovAdj)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
